# Writing

On this section you can find some of the stuff I wrote. Writing is something that helps me think more clearly and also enables me to express ideas and concepts through the written form. It is one habit I try to dedicate time to whenever I can, which these days is usually when I find time between studying physics and developing software.

### Fiction

Some short stories I wrote in the past couple of years. They were written in portuguese and I'll try to translate them eventually.

- [Ajudantes](/shortstories/ajudantes) *(english version soon...)*
- [O incêndio](/shortstories/incendio) *(english version soon...)*

### Non-Fiction

These include thoughts about science and technology and some reflections on how they impact modern life.
